## [Unreleased]

- Move back to using Vite, as the reason to move to Rollup was to use things like
  `rollup-plugin-dts`. Now we have `vite-plugin-dts` which achieves the same thing.

## [1.3.1] - 2024-07-14

- Small style cleanups and update to ESLint version.

## [1.3.0] - 2024-07-13

- Reduce the number of squares where browser touch actions like scrolling
  are disabled.

## [1.2.0] - 2023-12-22

- Fix misalignment of arrows with board when `coords` is set to `outside`.

## [1.1.2] - 2023-11-07

- Small style fixes

## [1.1.1] - 2022-12-18

- Small cleanup of Munkres algorithm code and comments

## [1.1.0] - 2022-12-18

- Add full ".js" extension to all imports, per https://justinfagnani.com/2019/11/01/how-to-publish-web-components-to-npm/
- Use Hungarian algorithm to find piece "moves" between two positions (#12)

## [1.0.0] - 2022-12-03

- Release 1.0.0

## [1.0.0-0] - 2022-12-03

- Make gchessboard a pure ESM package [notes](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c)

## [0.4.0] - 2022-11-27

### Added

- Magnify piece when dragging by touch (#35).

## [0.3.1] - 2022-03-03

- Explicitly export some types for use in libraries (e.g. `BoardArrow`, `MoveStartEvent`, etc)

## [0.3.0] - 2022-03-02

### Added

- Add a new `cancelMove()` method to imperatively cancel moves (#33).

## [0.2.2] - 2022-02-14

### Added

- Target for compiled JavaScript has been changed to ES2020 to balance the use of
  new features with widespread compatibility, since some build environments
  (unpkg, codesandbox default parcel build) do not seem to support new features like
  class properties.

- SVG chess pieces have been updated to correspond to the latest set from [Category:SVG chess pieces](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:SVG_chess_pieces) on Wikimedia (#30).

## [0.2.1] - 2022-02-12

### Added

- Added docs site and simple tutorial (#26).

## [0.2.0] - 2022-02-11

### Added

- Name of package file is now `index.es.js` instead of `gchessboard.es.js` to be consistent
  with naming for types file.

### Fixed

- The use of `mix-blend-mode: overlay` was causing different behavior across
  browsers, including missing arrowhead in Firefox and lighter than usual arrow colors
  in Chrome. This has now been fixed by removing the blend move property altogether.
- The SVG in demo `index.html` was not top-left aligned in Safari due to specification
  of a fixed height. This has now been fixed by removing the height specifier for the SVG.

## [0.1.2] - 2022-02-11

### Fixed

- Reduce lengths of arrowhead to ensure that short arrows render correctly.
  May need further tweaking in the future, or some kind of "minimum" length
  on an arrow to ensure that arrow length never goes negative.

## [0.1.1] - 2022-02-11

### Fixed

- Release from `main` branch as previous release was from a deleted branch.

## [0.1.0] - 2022-02-11

### Added

- Added support for displaying arrows on board, specified using a property called
  `arrows`. (#24)

## [0.0.5] - 2022-02-08

### Fixed

- Add missing `src/` directory to bundle to make source maps work correctly.

## [0.0.4] - 2022-02-08

### Added

- Replace Vite with Rollup as bundler and build system. This is to better control output
  of things like bundled types using `rollup-plugin-dts`. Also use `web-dev-server` to
  replace Vite's server.

### Fixed

## [0.0.3] - 2022-02-07

### Added

### Fixed

- Fixes bug where drag was not completing on mobile correctly (#20)

## [0.0.2] - 2022-02-06

### Added

- Initial release. Contains fully functioning chessboard with API documentation.
